# SmartAoE-Macros
Many of these macros have comments at the top of them to describe unique features or things that you may want to change for your individual game.
  -->When copying/pasting, be sure to remove these comments! 

All macros should start with "!smartaoe {{"         _or "!script {{..." if using scriptcards_
  -->Start with this line and copy all the way to the end
  
 Happy Gaming!
